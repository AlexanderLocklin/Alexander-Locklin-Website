![Engineering building](assets/eng.png)

I am a first-year Bachelors of Applied Science, Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Previously, I graduated from Huron Heights Secondary School as an Ontario Scholar, four year honour role student, and attained a specialist high skilled major in Environment.

Through my coursework and project work, I have developed hands-on experience in SolidWorks, Autocad, fusion360, C++, Java, Python as well as practical knowledge of mechatronics design and analysis. My team and I have used these tools to create a robotic gantry using 3d printed parts of my own design, and vex-robotic components that can retrieve an object and relocate it. 

As a member of the UW Formula SAE team, I collaborate with fellow students to design and test lightweight suspension components, reducing weight while maintaining structural integrity. This experience strengthened my teamwork, technical, and project management abilities—skills I am confident will translate well in a professional engineering environment.

I am Passionate about innovative technology solutions, project advancement, refinement of designs, creative problem solving according to constraints. My mission  in engineering is to design the smart electromechanical systems powering today’s most exciting technologies.
