I assembled custom 3d printed and off-the-shelf components to an integrated system, and programmed an embedded stepper motor controller using a Seeeduino microcontroller for photographing stellar objects. I designed and printed components to integrate equipment based on measurements and specifications of what was available, and employ image processing involving hundreds of images to produce high-quality photographs.
